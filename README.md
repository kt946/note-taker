# Note Taker

## Description

For this week's challenge, I built a Note Taker application using my knowledge of JavaScript, NPM, Express.js, and Heroku. This project allows a user to easily write, save, and delete notes to keep track of tasks, thoughts, and events in a user-friendly interface deployed to Heroku. Developing the Note Taker application enabled me to explore the fundamentals of Express.js and the complexities of back-end development, such as GET and POST request and creating routes that link front-end HTML pages to back-end systems. Additional technologies include the [uuid package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid) from npm to generate unique ids for each note.
